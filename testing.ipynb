But this is hard for us to\\nempathize with because we're not the recipients; we're the returns.[2]\\nKnowledge did of course have a practical effect before the\\nIndustrial Revolution. The development of agriculture changed human\\nlife completely. But this kind of change was the result of broad,\\ngradual improvements in technique, not the discoveries of a few\\nexceptionally learned people.[3]\\nIt's not mathematically correct to describe a step function as\\nsuperlinear, but a step function starting from zero works like a\\nsuperlinear function when it describes the reward curve for effort\\nby a rational actor. If it starts at zero then the part before the\\nstep is below any linearly increasing return, and the part after\\nthe step must be above the necessary return at that point or no one\\nwould bother.[4]\\nSeeking competition could be a good heuristic in the sense that\\nsome people find it motivating. It's also somewhat of a guide to\\npromising problems, because it's a sign that other people find them\\npromising. But it's a very imperfect sign: often there's a clamoring\\ncrowd chasing some problem, and they all end up being trumped by\\nsomeone quietly working on another one.[5]\", metadata={'language': 'No language found.', 'source': 'http://www.paulgraham.com/superlinear.html', 'title': 'Superlinear Returns'}),\n",

Superlinear returns imply inequality. The steeper the return\\ncurve, the greater the variation in outcomes.In fact, the correlation between superlinear returns and inequality\\nis so strong that it yields another heuristic for finding work of\\nthis type: look for fields where a few big winners outperform\\neveryone else.

In\\npolitics, power grows much as it did in the days of emperors. And\\nin some of the other fields (including politics) success is driven\\nlargely by fame, which has its own source of superlinear growth.\\nBut when we exclude sports and politics and the effects of fame, a\\nremarkable pattern emerges: the remaining list is exactly the same\\nas the list of fields where you have to be independent-minded to\", metadata={'language': 'No language found.', 'source': 'http://www.paulgraham.com/superlinear.html', 'title': 'Superlinear Returns'}),\n",
